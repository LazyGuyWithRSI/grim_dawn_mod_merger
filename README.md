# Grim Dawn Mod Merger

isn't it lame that Grim Dawn only allows you to load one mod at a time? Now you can play all your favorite mods at the same time!

## Getting Started

Simply download the [latest release](https://github.com/LazyGuyWithRSI/grim_dawn_mod_merger/releases) to start merging. All you need to do is point it at your Grim Dawn install folder and have some mods in your 'mods' folder.


***Important:*** This is a very new tool. There will be bugs. Please report any issues you have so they can be fixed ASAP :)
